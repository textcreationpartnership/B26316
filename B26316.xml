            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>Loyalty Vindicated FROM THE Calumnies cast upon it by <hi>Richard Janeway</hi> in his <hi>Im-Partial Mercury.</hi> In a <hi>LETTER</hi> from an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentice of <hi>London</hi> to a <hi>Worthy Citizen.</hi>
            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT is no less Common than True, that desperate Diseases must have desperate Cures, and that ill-minded and malicious men will not leave any Stone unturned to gain their wisht-for ends; let the Design be but propitious to their Cause, they never stand to parley about its honesty, but wrong or right resolve to attempt it; and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this Verse,
<q xml:lang="lat">Flectere si nequeant populos Acharonta movebunt.</q>
            </p>
            <p>which is too too apparent in these Times, when the Nation is ready to be split in pieces by the Hellish Designs and Contrivances of her two Grand Enemies, <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Faction;</hi> who like Juglers, deal under Board to bubble the credulous Rout into the belief of the well meaning of their Designs; when all that have their Eyes or Understandings find them to be no otherwise than the <hi>Hocus Tricks</hi> of Jesuitical <hi>Legerdemain:</hi> yet notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the many Discoveries and Discouragements they have met with, they are still resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to persist, and not only venture the hazarding of their Reputation and Lives, but even the Damnation of their immortal Souls; and all this under the mask of Religion, and doing God good Service: so that the Nation now happily escaped from the <hi>Roman Tyranny,</hi> is like to fall into the <hi>Factious Golgotha,</hi> and be once more turned into a field of <hi>War</hi> and <hi>Bloodshed:</hi> but God who seeth the Contrivances of our Enemies, will laugh <hi>them to scorn, and the sons of men shall have them in derision.</hi> We have now blessed be God a Wise and Gracious Prince, a Faithful and Understanding Council, by whose endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours and Gods blessing we are in a fair way of returning to a setled Peace again, did not the restless Designs of a Party (who do falsely style themselves Protestants) amuse the Hearts of the people, and put an <hi>odium</hi> upon all His Majesties proceedings.</p>
            <p>But, that it may not be thought that the Nation is void of Loyalty and Obedience, and that the Subjects are become altogether Rebellious, the Truly Loyal have taken such courses by way of <hi>Adresses,</hi> as to assure His most Gracious Majesty of their Fidelity and Resolutions to be ready to lay both their Lives and Fortunes at his most Sacred Feet, in vindication of his Person and Prerogative, if ever occasion shall require; and amongst these great numbers of <hi>Adresses</hi> from <hi>Counties, Grand-Juries, Justices</hi> and <hi>Corporations,</hi> there is one now in agitation by the <hi>Loyal Young Men and Apprentices of London,</hi> which for the Loyalty of their Intentions, and Number of Subscribers humbly desires to have Acceptance from His Majesties Royal Bounty: But no sooner was this Loyal <hi>Adress</hi> made publick, but it meets with the calumnious railing of Factious and Disloyal Spirits, who do not fear to blaze their Impudent Lyes and Railings in the face of the World, to put a stop to this Loyal Intention; to attain which, they give out by their <hi>Partial Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi> That the Loyalty of this Design was hatched in <hi>Newgate</hi> by Priests and Jesuites; That it is a Second Part of Captain <hi>Tom's</hi> Plot, and carried on by Raskals and beggerly Vermin, enticed only by Pots of Ale, and many such <hi>Billingsgate-Reasons,</hi> and <hi>Stories</hi> which I shall forbear to mention. And though I do not know the Author of this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny, and so can say no more, than that I take him to be one whose Reason consists in Railing, and his Honesty in abusing his Betters, like the envious Dog in the Fable, who will eat no Hay himself, nor suffer those that will. But as for his Pimp <hi>Dick Jane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi> him I know, and will leave it to the World to judge if he be not a person whose very name is Scandal to the Books he spues into the World. But that I may shew you the Impudence of their Intentions by the Lyes they vent into the World, I will give you the true Original of this so Loyal and so much envied <hi>Address.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. As for the first Promoters and Inventers of it, Be it known to all the World, that it was neither a <hi>Priest</hi> nor <hi>Jesuite,</hi> but the honest Intentions of some Young Men of good Parentage and Principles; whose Names may be seen in the <hi>Address</hi> it self, and who are always ready, when call'd by Authority, to stand to their <hi>Address</hi> and <hi>Principles;</hi> but why they should give Account of themselves to <hi>Hen-peckt-Dick,</hi> I am not satisfied, but can say they are such that <hi>Janeway</hi> himself may be glad to earn his Bread from.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That it is a Capt. <hi>Tom</hi>'s Plot is so ridiculous a Story, that nothing but the
<pb facs="tcp:200323:2"/>Bigotted Faith of a Factious Fanatick will credit or give ear to; for I here challenge all the whole Tribe of factious Pensioners, and all the Cabal of restless Scriblers to prove one word in the said <hi>Address</hi> that can be screw'd up to that Notion of <hi>Plot,</hi> unless they can make Loyalty to the King, a Plotting against his Person; and thankful acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Duty and submission of our selves to His Majesties Service to be resisting his Authority; unless, I say, they can prove this, they cannot bring our Loyal <hi>Address</hi> under that scandalous name of <hi>Plot:</hi> but since <hi>Dick</hi> and his Tribe have said it, there are Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands will swear it, and so it is, a <hi>Plot</hi> it must be.</p>
            <p>A third <hi>Sham</hi> or <hi>Odium</hi> that is spued upon this Loyal <hi>Address,</hi> is, That it is carried on by Raskals and beggerly Vermin, &amp;c. I dare say, there is no such Vermin concerned as those that crawl'd after the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s Coach from his <hi>Wapping</hi> Treat, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the ears of people with Factious Huzza's, and <hi>G—dam—</hi> upon the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and No Bishops. I warrant these were no beggarly Vermin, nor inticed by Pots of Ale? I can assure <hi>Dick Janeway</hi> we have no such Vermin concern'd in our <hi>Address,</hi> we are all <hi>Abhorrers</hi> of such Factious Huzza's and <hi>Wapping</hi> Treats; but we will leave <hi>Dicks</hi> Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min at <hi>Wapping</hi> and <hi>Billingsgate,</hi> the place of their Nativity and Breeding, and return to vindicate the Truly Loyal from that scandalous name of <hi>Vermin,</hi> and let <hi>Dick Janeway</hi> know, that the <hi>major</hi> part concern'd, are Sons of Gentlemen, who daily see how the Decay of Trade increases, by his and his Fellows Designs, that they are more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to venture their Lives in his Majesties Serviee, than to become Free-men of this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, if they must enter into Poverty and Freedom at one time; And if <hi>Dick</hi> can produce one <hi>Vermin</hi> concern'd in the <hi>Address,</hi> for shame let him produce him, and in lieu of him, I will produce Thousands, the very meanest of which, is able to buy <hi>Him, Care, Curtis,</hi> and <hi>Vile,</hi> and all their Lands and Tenements, Goods and Chattels, who, I think, are such Vermin as to have no more than from Hand to Mouth; and did not the Times aford mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to Scribble on, and Books to Publish, would be glad to pass from door to door to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Alms of those Vermine, as he calls the Sons of <hi>Worthy Gentlemen,</hi> whose Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents will give him no thanks for his Complement.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Another <hi>Sham</hi> or <hi>Slur</hi> that these Cheats put upon us, that are Truly Loyal, is, That we procure <hi>Subscribers</hi> that never knew vvhat they subscribed to; this <hi>Sham</hi> is so evidently false, that nothing but the Impudence of a disturbing <hi>Whig</hi> durst vent it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World, and it is so ridiculous a Story, that all that see or hear it, will rather be incited to Laughter than desirous to Answer: but that <hi>Dick</hi> may not vaunt of his not being Answered, let him know, I take his Author and he for two of <hi>Goatham</hi> Politicks, for there is not one that subscribed that did not first read, and then consider the whole substance of the <hi>Address,</hi> and were so far satisfied of its Loyalty, that had they a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Hands none should be wanting to farther so laudable a Design: which is not only to show our Loyalty, but to regain our Reputations, which was blemisht by our Predecessors in the late Times of <hi>Presbyterian Disturbance:</hi> and though Mounsieur <hi>Impartial</hi> charges us with medling with State Affairs, it is evident by the <hi>Address</hi> it self that we do not, but rely upon His Majesties Wisdom in governing the Nation. A thing he and his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers have resolved not to do, but if possible, to have themselves the only Counsellors of the Nation. But let them know, that all that have set their Hands to the <hi>Address</hi> are devoted to his Majesties Service against all his Enemies, as well <hi>Papists</hi> as <hi>Commonwealths<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;</hi> and in the mean time value the railing of <hi>Dick</hi> and his Tribe no more than to make them the subject of laughter, and the sport of their Discourse; a thing he has truly merit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by being concerned in anothers Affairs. But we may see which way the wind blows, when all things that have Loyalty in them go down like so many Hob-nails, and when all are called <hi>Vermin,</hi> and such Names that dare say they love the King, and will die for him; And as for that Letter published in the next <hi>Mercury,</hi> I take it to be a Pig of <hi>Dick's</hi> own Sow: For suppose <hi>Dick Janeway</hi> should agree with <hi>Harry Care</hi> to send that Letter to him by the Penny Post, might not <hi>Dick</hi> say with a safe Conscience, that he received it by the Penny Post, and so put it upon whom he pleases? And yet the Loyal Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices be Innocent; for I know none of them of those damning and blaspheming Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; and all that ever I can hear of, detest such Practices.</p>
            <p>But I am credibly inform'd, that <hi>Dick Janeway</hi> would be honest if his Dame would let him: Alas Poor <hi>Dick!</hi> I thought whereabouts thy Shoe rung thee; so that I see it is not for want of Will, but for want of Power, that <hi>Dick Janeway</hi> is not a <hi>Tory.</hi> Well, as a Friend I'll give him my Advice, I would have him put it up for a Grievance next Parliament, or get a Cross, and <hi>Lord have Mercy upon us,</hi> set upon his Door; for certainly a Wise-ridden-man has the greatest Plague upon Earth. I'll only teach Him a short Prayer to use in the time of his Tribulation, and so leave him to the Malice of his Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male Tutor.</p>
